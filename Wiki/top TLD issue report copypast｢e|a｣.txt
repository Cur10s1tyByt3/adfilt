The blocking of all .top sites is intentional, due to .top traditionally being associated with malware outside East Asia.

But whitelistings are granted on request fairly quickly if the site is not:
* An instant redirect to a non-.top site.
* A sports/movie streaming site.
* An Apache test page.
* A placeholder page.
* An empty page.
* Failing to load at all.
